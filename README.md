# Testing-Notes

Modern applications using DevOps, Cloud, Cloud Native, and Micro Services require us
to another look at how we are testing our solutions.

This is a spot for me to start organizing my thoughts.

Development Notes:
- This is written in ascidoc
- Using Atom with AsciiDoc Plugin
- gradle and asciidoctor plugin
- Diagrams were created with Draw.io
