== MicroService

In this section, we will look at the components of a MicroService.

=== Resource
Resources act as mappers between the application protocol exposed by the service
and messages to objects representing the domain. Typically, they are thin, with
responsibility for sanity checking the request and providing a protocol specific
response according to the outcome of the business transaction.

=== Domain
Almost all of the service logic resides in a domain model representing the
business domain. Of these objects, services coordinate across multiple domain
activities, whilst repositories act on collections of domain entities and are
often persistence backed.

=== Gateway
If one service has another service as a collaborator, some logic is needed to
communicate with the external service. A gateway encapsulates message passing
with a remote service, marshalling requests and responses from and to domain
objects. It will likely use a client that understands the underlying protocol
to handle the request-response cycle.


=== Repositories
Except in the most trivial cases or when a service acts as an aggregator across
resources owned by other services, a micro-service will need to be able to
persist objects from the domain between requests. Usually this is achieved using
object relation mapping or more lightweight data mappers depending on the
complexity of the persistence requirements.

Often, this logic is encapsulated in a set of dedicated objects utilised by
repositories from the domain.
